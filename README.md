Term paper of "Network &amp; System Defense" class (A.Y. 2021/2022) [Prof. A. Pellegrini]

## Specification
This project entails writing some protection mechanism in the Linux kernel (as a patch, a security
module, a simple module, ...) to prevent malicious loadable kernel modules to tamper with
internal data structures of the kernel.

In particular, beyond the example that we have discussed in class, it is possible that a module will
not perform any attack during the loading phase, but it will perform some form of delayed attack
(e.g., by relying on a Tasklet). Your scheme should also be able to perform this kind of detection.

If a module is detected as malicious, it must be unmounted, and any possible side effect
generated by it should be reverted.
